# Activities Search App! (Optimized for mobile)

Create a web front-end that allows searching for activities. Think about the needs of a traveler that is looking for things to do in a destination. For example, a person visiting Berlin that is interested in things to do during their visit.

For purposes of this take-home test, we provide you with a static JSON file containing dummy activity data. We recommend timeboxing development to 4 hours.

### Rules:

* At a minimum, we expect a search feature that lists activities based on user input
* We value the delivered product as much as we value technologies used, UX matters
* Add any additional features you see useful for travelers
* The app should be styled with proper UX and UI in mind
* Use HTML, CSS and JavaScript
* Use the tools, libraries or frameworks you think are appropriate. Please don't use code generators
* Include brief documentation why you added certain product features and an explanation of your technology choice

### Not to worry:

* Only support the very latest version of Chrome
* The app should run in the browser. It is OK to inline the dummy activity data so that no server is needed
* Only optimize for mobile screen sizes. No tablet or desktop layouts required
* No branding, header, or footer content necessary

## Available Scripts

Important! Please install the node modules with `npm start` before running the scripts.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>

If you want to run the production build locally, navigate to the build folder in the terminal and start a local server.
